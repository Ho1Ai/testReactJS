# Testing TypeScript

I am testing React with TypeScript. I just wanna check this stuff, no more. Also I am gonna try axios (previously used fetch btw)

I am gonna write a good project next time. Now I am trying on React (and, maybe, axios). Also testing Git by the way.

Project freezed, because I have started another project (which one is bigger than this one)
